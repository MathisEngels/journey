# My beginnings

When I was 11, I went to stay with my uncle, who works in the computer industry.
During my stay, he showed me that with his computer you could make very simple little programs.
That's when I wrote my first lines of code, a batch script that displayed "Hello World" in the console.
Nothing too complex, but it was enough to give me a taste for programming.

Back home, I started learning about loops, conditions, variables, functions and so on.
Then I started showing my little projects to my friends, proud of what I'd learned.

And then I realized that there had to be a better way than just displaying text on a black background.
I started playing with `shutdown` or `del` (I admit it wasn't very clever of me).
And then the classic HTML, CSS to make those first websites.

That was when I really realized what programming was all about. A fascinating universe, where you can create anything you want, be free, handle data as you please, and above all, solve problems.

I even created little games on my TI-82+ calculator when I was in high school. I'll leave you to imagine the complexity of these games (in TI-Basic), but I still managed to make a "hot or cold" and a "the right price", which was all the rage when we got bored.
