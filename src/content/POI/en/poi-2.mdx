# My studies

After passing my Bac S, I decided to study computer science to finally satisfy my passion.
I enrolled at the UPHF (Université Polytechnique Hauts-de-France) for a degree in computer science. I chose this university because of its reputation for the quality of its computer science teaching.

Over the past 3 years, I've gained a wealth of skills and experience. Programming, algorithms, networks, operating systems, databases, artificial intelligence, C, Java, Python and SQL were now familiar terms that I could master.
I was also able to discover many areas of computer science, some of which I preferred, others of which I was less familiar with.

During my studies, I worked on group projects, which helped me develop my teamwork skills.

I went on to study for a master's degree in computer science at UPHF, specializing in cybersecurity. I chose this specialization because my initial project was to become a pentester. As I progressed through my master's degree, I realized that I was having more fun developing than testing system security.
Nevertheless, I went ahead with this specialization, which now helps me every day in my work. Indeed, having the knowledge to understand how attacks and vulnerabilities work, I'm able to develop more secure solutions as a result.

During this master's degree, I also did a 6-month internship, which I invite you to discover by continuing the experience.

At the end of these 5 years, I obtained an engineering degree in cybersecurity from INSA (Institut National des Sciences Appliquées).

At the same time, I worked on various personal projects, which enabled me to continuously develop my programming skills. Continue the experiment to discover them.
