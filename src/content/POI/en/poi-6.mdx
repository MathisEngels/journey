# The beginning of the adventure

I decided to go freelance. Why did I do it?
To be happier in my work.
Being able to choose my assignments and the people I work with stimulates me enormously.

Thanks to my professional experience, my personal projects and the people I've met, I've acquired skills and knowledge that enable me to embark on this adventure.

I'm passionate about web and mobile development, and I'm convinced that I can bring real added value to my customers.
As a freelancer, I can devote myself fully to my projects and my customers, and offer them a quality service.

Come closer to the plane to embark on this adventure with me!

I'm looking forward to bringing your projects to life and helping you make them a reality.
