# My projects

As said before, I've had the opportunity to work on several projects. In this section, I'd like to present a few of them, you can see the list of my projects <Link>here</Link>.

## Moulin dashboard

During my studies, my father had just completely redone his garden. As part of his renovation, he wanted an automatic watering management system. So I decided to create one for him.

To achieve this, I used a Raspberry Pi, several relays and solenoid valves. On the code side, I chose the NextJS framework, so as to learn a new framework, and have the back and front ends in a single codebase.
I'm also using a MongoDB database to store information in the event of a reboot, and SocketIO to allow several users to be connected simultaneously.

The system is exposed directly on the web, allowing my father to manage his watering from his phone (don't worry, there's an authentication system (Cookie and JWT), and it's exposed on a particular port).

Thanks to this project, you can program how long you want to water, manually trigger the system and some statistics.

After completing the automatic watering, my father came up with the idea of managing the outdoor lighting and the electric gate. So I implemented these functions in the project.

For the lighting, I use a public API to retrieve the sunrise and sunset times, and I've implemented logic that turns the lights on according to the configuration. Currently, the system switches on at sunset and off at 1:00 am.

For the gate, I used a relay to simulate pressing the remote control button. The interface is a simple button that lets you open, stop and close the gate.

This project is still running, and is used daily by my father (for 3 years now).

Thanks to this project, I was able to learn a new framework, and put my knowledge of electronics into practice. I was also able to learn how to manage a project from A to Z, from design to production. Several issues came up, such as the processor architecture to be taken into account, multiple simultaneous users and authentication management.
This enabled me to develop my skills in web development, electronics and project management.

Even if this project is functional, a redesign would be welcome. The code isn't very clean, and some features could be improved. For example, the interface could be made more intuitive and the logic improved.

Stack: NextJS, NodeJS, SocketIO, MongoDB.

## Homelab

I've been interested in self-hosting for a few years now. So I decided to create my own server.
I bought another raspberry, to make a small cluster (of 2).
On this cluster, I've got Docker up and running. I also have a NAS to store my data.
This little homelab lets me experiment, test new technologies and have fun. So I've been able to dabble in Ansible, Terraform, CI/CD, and selfhosting in general.

I have a VPN that lets me access my local network, and therefore my services, from anywhere. I also have a monitoring system, which lets me see the status of my services, and receive alerts in the event of a problem.

Above all, I've been able to learn a lot about Docker, containerization and deployment. I also took the time to learn how to use cloud platforms like AWS, GCP and Azure.

Stack: Docker, Ansible, Terraform, CI/CD, Cloud.
