# My end-of-studies internship

During my studies, I was able to carry out a 6-month internship to develop my skills and discover the corporate world.

## Company presentation

I chose to do my end-of-studies internship at [Sopra Banking Software](https://www.soprabanking.com/), a subsidiary of Sopra Steria, which is a European leader in digital transformation.
Sopra Banking Software is a banking software publisher, offering solutions for banks and financial institutions. Headquartered in Paris, the company is present in over 70 countries.

## Project presentation

During this internship, I had the opportunity to work on a project aimed at T2 and T3 banks (small and medium-sized banks).
The project is cloud-native, with a microservices architecture. It's based on modern technologies such as Spring Boot, Kubernetes, AngularJS, and Typescript.

I had the opportunity to work on all aspects of the project, doing front-end development with AngularJS (using Typescript), many of the back-end services (Java and Spring Boot), and production (Kube and CI/CD).
Because of my studies, I brought a fresh vision to the project, and was able to propose innovative solutions, particularly concerning personal data security (to comply with the RGPD, proposing Hashage and data encryption solutions).
I also practiced agile methods, working in teams, doing code reviews, and taking part in daily meetings.

The project was divided into 3 different teams, and mine was made up of 8 people. I was able to work with developers, architects, project managers and product owners.

An important point to note is that I was able to work in an international environment, with people of many different nationalities. English was therefore omnipresent, and used on a daily basis.

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed this internship, thanks to the freedom and trust I was given (thank you Bruno for your trust). I was able to develop my technical skills, but also my human skills, by working in a team, being autonomous, and taking on responsibilities.

Following this internship, I was offered the chance to continue working at Sopra Banking Software. I wanted to explore other horizons, so I declined the offer (which I invite you to discover in the next section).

However, I have very fond memories of the experience, and I'm grateful to the company and the people I worked with.

Thanks to the whole team for this enriching experience, and thanks again to Bruno for his trust and humanism.
