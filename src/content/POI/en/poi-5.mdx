# My professional experience

I've had the opportunity to work for several companies. Here's an overview of my professional experience.

## 2023 - 2023 : Smile

After leaving Axa, I wanted to take a job as a software developer. I applied to Smile, an ESN that allowed me to work on a variety of projects.
I had the opportunity to work on software development projects for large and small accounts. I was able to work on software development projects, but also on projects to redesign existing software.

Thanks to the knowledge I've acquired, my desire to have more freedom and to choose the missions that interest me, I've decided to leave Smile and go freelance. I invite you to discover this in the last section.

Stack: React.js, Node.js, Javascript, Typescript, Java, Git.

## 2022 - 2022 : [Axa](https://www.axa.fr/)

Following my internship, I had the opportunity to work for Axa. During our interviews, we concluded that my missions would consist of DevOps development, while retaining the software development aspect that I love so much.

Once in my position, I worked on missions that differed from what had been agreed. Instead of being in a software development position with DevOps practices, I found myself doing Operations (implementing new releases, managing incidents, etc.). In order not to waste time, I decided to learn as much as I could about the subject, but I soon realized that this wasn't what I wanted to do.
I also had the opportunity to help out on a React.js front-end project.
So, at the end of my trial period, I decided to leave the company.

Thanks to this experience, I learned what the problems were on the operational side, and how developers can help solve them before they arise.
To this day, I use this knowledge to write cleaner code to make it easier to put into production.

Stack: React.js, Azure DevOps, Terraform, Ansible, Git, Jenkins, SonarQube, Jira, Confluence, Python.
